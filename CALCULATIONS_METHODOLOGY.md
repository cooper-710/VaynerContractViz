## Overview

This application provides comprehensive contract valuation and analysis for MLB free agents. It uses historical comparable player data, inflation-adjusted market analysis, and position-specific statistical weighting to estimate fair contract terms.

### Core Methodology
- **Comparable Player Analysis**: Historical contracts of similar players form the baseline
- **Statistical Performance Adjustment**: Player performance metrics adjust baseline values
- **Position-Specific Weights**: Different positions emphasize different statistical categories
- **Market Inflation**: Contracts are adjusted for salary inflation over time
- **Age-Performance Curves**: Age impacts both contract length and value

---

## Contract Valuation (AAV Estimation)

### 1. Baseline Calculation

**Formula**: 
```
Baseline AAV = Average(Selected Comparable Player AAVs, Inflation-Adjusted)
```

**Process**:
1. Select comparable players (similar position, age range, performance level)
2. Retrieve historical contract AAV for each comparable
3. Adjust each AAV for inflation from signing year to present year
4. Calculate mean of adjusted AAVs

**Inflation Adjustment**:
```
Adjusted AAV = Historical AAV × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Years Since Signing)
```
- Default inflation rate: 5% per year
- Adjustable by user (0-15%)

### 2. Statistical Performance Multiplier

**Formula**:
```
AAV Multiplier = Weighted Sum of Stat Ratios / Total Weights
Final AAV = Baseline AAV × AAV Multiplier (clamped 0.75-1.4)
```

**Statistical Categories & Default Weights**:

| Stat | Label | Weight | Higher is Better |
|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| fg_RBI | RBI | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_HR | HR | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_OPS | OPS | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_wRC+ | wRC+ | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_BB% | BB% | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_K% | K% | 0.1 | No (lower is better) |
| fg_PA | PA | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_WAR | WAR | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_xwOBA | xwOBA | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_xSLG | xSLG | 0.1 | Yes |
| sc_EV_brl_pa | Barrel% | 0.1 | Yes |
| sc_EV_ev50 | avgEV | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_Def | Def | 0.1 | Yes |
| fg_BsR | BsR | 0.1 | Yes |

**Position-Specific Weight Adjustments**:

Weights vary by position to reflect positional value. Examples:

**1B/DH (Power Positions)**:
- Higher weights: HR (0.65), wRC+ (0.70), RBI (0.50)
- Lower weights: Def (0.10), BsR (0.15)
- Total weight sum: 5.0

**SS/2B (Premium Defense)**:
- Higher weights: Def (1.00), WAR (0.60), PA (0.50)
- Lower weights: HR (0.20), RBI (0.20)
- Total weight sum: 5.0

**CF/OF (Balanced)**:
- Higher weights: Def (0.70), BsR (0.55), WAR (0.60)
- Moderate offensive weights
- Total weight sum: 5.0

**Ratio Calculation**:

For each stat:
```
If higherBetter:
    ratio = Player Value / Cohort Average Value
Else (lower is better, e.g., K%):
    ratio = Cohort Average Value / Player Value

ratio = clamp(ratio, 0.1, 10.0)
```

Special handling for Defense and Base Running (can be negative):
```
delta = Player Value - Cohort Average
typical_range = 10
delta_ratio = 1 + (delta / typical_range) × 0.2
ratio = clamp(delta_ratio, 0.5, 2.0)
```

**Weighted Multiplier**:
```
For each stat:
    contribution = (ratio - 1) × weight
    
weighted_sum = sum(ratio × weight) for all stats
total_weight = sum(weights)
raw_multiplier = weighted_sum / total_weight

Final AAV Multiplier = clamp(raw_multiplier, 0.75, 1.4)
```

**Individual Stat Impact on AAV**:
```
For each stat:
    stat_multiplier = 1 + (contribution / total_weight)
    aav_impact = baseline_AAV × contribution / total_weight
```

### 3. Final AAV Calculation

```
Fair AAV = Baseline AAV × AAV Multiplier
```

User can toggle adjustments on/off to see baseline vs. adjusted values.

---

## Contract Length Formula

### 1. Baseline Years

**Formula**:
```
Baseline Years = Average(Selected Comparable Player Contract Years)
```

Simple arithmetic mean of contract lengths from selected comparables.

### 2. Age Adjustment (Player-Friendly Version)

**Age Delta**:
```
age_delta = Player Age - Cohort Average Signing Age
older_delta = max(0, age_delta)
younger_delta = max(0, -age_delta)
```

**Age Multiplier Components**:

Penalty for older players (quadratic curve):
```
penalty_component = (0.05 × older_delta) + (0.010 × older_delta²)
```

Benefit for younger players (with diminishing returns):
```
benefit_component = (0.03 × younger_delta) - (0.005 × younger_delta²)
```

**Raw Age Multiplier**:
```
raw_age_multiplier = 1 - penalty_component + benefit_component
age_multiplier = clamp(raw_age_multiplier, 0.6, 1.5)
```

**Absolute Age Penalty** (additional penalty for players 31+):
```
If player_age >= 31:
    absolute_age_penalty = min(2.0, (player_age - 30) × 0.25)
Else:
    absolute_age_penalty = 0
```

Examples:
- Age 30: 0 years penalty
- Age 31: 0.25 years penalty
- Age 35: 1.25 years penalty
- Age 38+: 2.0 years penalty (capped)

### 3. Performance Adjustment

**Formula**:
```
performance_adjustment_raw = (aav_multiplier - 1) × 1.8
performance_adjustment = clamp(performance_adjustment_raw, -1.5, 1.5)
```

This links contract length to performance quality:
- Elite performers (AAV multiplier > 1) get longer deals
- Underperformers (AAV multiplier < 1) get shorter deals
- Impact is amplified (1.8×) compared to AAV effect
- Capped at ±1.5 years

### 4. Total Years Adjustment

**Formula**:
```
years_adjustment = ((baseline_years × age_multiplier) - baseline_years) 
                   - absolute_age_penalty 
                   + performance_adjustment

proposed_years = baseline_years + years_adjustment
```

### 5. Soft Cap & Rounding

**Soft Cap**:
```
capped_years = min(baseline_years + 2.0, proposed_years)
```

Cannot exceed baseline by more than 2.0 years, even with perfect performance and young age.

**Final Rounding**:
```
fair_years = max(1, round(capped_years × 2) / 2)
```

Rounds to nearest 0.5 years, minimum 1 year.

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: 30-year-old 1B, cohort baseline 8.8 years, cohort signing age 28, AAV multiplier 1.1

```
age_delta = 30 - 28 = 2
older_delta = 2, younger_delta = 0

penalty_component = (0.05 × 2) + (0.010 × 4) = 0.14
benefit_component = 0
raw_age_multiplier = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86
age_multiplier = 0.86 (within 0.6-1.5 bounds)

absolute_age_penalty = 0 (age 30, not 31+)

performance_adjustment_raw = (1.1 - 1) × 1.8 = 0.18
performance_adjustment = 0.18 (within ±1.5 bounds)

years_adjustment = ((8.8 × 0.86) - 8.8) - 0 + 0.18
                 = -1.23 + 0.18 = -1.05

proposed_years = 8.8 - 1.05 = 7.75
capped_years = min(10.8, 7.75) = 7.75
fair_years = round(7.75 × 2) / 2 = 8.0 years
```

## Team Fit Analysis

### 1. Composite Score (Position Rankings)

**Purpose**: Rank players at the same position within a team or division relative to target player.

**Formula**:
```
For each stat:
    baseline_value = Target Player Value
    compare_value = Comparison Player Value
    
    If higherBetter:
        ratio = compare_value / baseline_value
    Else:
        ratio = baseline_value / compare_value
    
    ratio = clamp(ratio, 0.1, 10.0)
    
    contribution = (ratio - 1) × position_weight

composite_score = sum(contributions)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Score = 0: Exactly matches target player (baseline)
- Score > 0: Better than target player
- Score < 0: Worse than target player
- Typical range: -3.0 to +3.0

**Position Weights**: Same as AAV calculation, position-specific.

### 2. Depth Chart Impact

**Methodology**:

1. **Current Score**: Target player's composite score (always 0 vs. themselves)

2. **Projected Score Range** (age-based decline):
```
If player_age >= 32:
    annual_decline = 0.15
ElseIf player_age >= 30:
    annual_decline = 0.12
ElseIf player_age >= 27:
    annual_decline = 0.08
Else:
    annual_decline = 0.03

projected_score_min = current_score - (annual_decline × contract_years × 1.2)
projected_score_max = current_score - (annual_decline × contract_years × 0.8)
```

3. **Replacement Risk**:
```
best_replacement = next best player at position on team (who played in 2024/2025)
replacement_score = composite_score(best_replacement vs. target)
replacement_risk = -replacement_score (negative, represents loss)
```

If no replacement available: replacement_risk = 0 (full loss of production)

### 3. Division Rankings

**Process**:
1. Filter all players by primary position
2. Filter by division (6 divisions: AL/NL East/Central/West)
3. Calculate composite scores vs. target player
4. Sort by composite score (descending)
5. Assign ranks (1 = best, higher = worse)

**Statistical Rankings**:
- Individual stats (wRC+, HR, WAR, etc.) ranked separately
- Sort by raw stat value
- For K%, lower is better (reverse sort)

## Contract Structure Calculations

### 1. Salary Distribution

**Even Structure**:
```
yearly_salary = base_AAV (constant each year)
```

**Front-Loaded Structure**:
```
load_factor = 1 + (front_load_percent / 100) × (1 - year_index / (total_years - 1))
yearly_salary = base_AAV × load_factor
```

**Back-Loaded Structure**:
```
load_factor = 1 + (front_load_percent / 100) × (year_index / (total_years - 1))
yearly_salary = base_AAV × load_factor
```

**Normalization** (ensures total matches base contract value):
```
current_total = sum(yearly_salaries)
adjustment_factor = (base_AAV × years) / current_total
Each yearly_salary × adjustment_factor
```

### 2. Signing Bonus

- Added to Year 1 cash flow
- Spread evenly across all years for CBT calculation
- Counts toward guaranteed money

### 3. Performance Bonuses

**Types**:
- Performance bonus (stats-based)
- Award bonus (MVP, All-Star, etc.)
- Playing time bonus (games played, PA thresholds)

**Projection** (for total value estimate):
```
projected_bonus = (perf_bonus + award_bonus + playtime_bonus) × 0.6
```

Assumes 60% achievement rate each year.

**Total Value Impact**:
- Added to yearly cash flow
- Not guaranteed (excluded from guaranteed value)
- Included in potential value (100% achievement)

### 4. Salary Escalators

**Trigger**: Conditional performance clauses (e.g., All-Star selection, 140+ games)

**Calculation**:
```
If escalator_triggered (year > 1):
    escalator_chance = 0.4 (40% probability)
    additional_salary = yearly_salary × (escalator_percent / 100) × escalator_chance
    yearly_salary += additional_salary
```

For projections, assumes 40% chance per year after Year 1.

### 5. Deferrals

**Deferred Amount**:
```
total_cash_before_deferral = yearly_salary + bonuses
deferred_amount = total_cash_before_deferral × (deferral_percent / 100)
cash_paid = total_cash_before_deferral - deferred_amount
```

**Present Value** (for CBT calculation):
```
PV = deferred_amount / (1 + interest_rate)^deferral_years
```

**CBT Impact**:
```
cbt_hit = yearly_salary + signing_bonus_prorated - (deferred_amount - present_value)
```

Deferrals reduce CBT hit because future money is less valuable (time value of money).

### 6. Contract Value Calculations

**Total Value**:
```
total_value = sum(yearly_base_salary + yearly_bonuses)
```

**Guaranteed Value**:
```
guaranteed_value = (base_AAV × years) + signing_bonus
```

Excludes performance bonuses (not guaranteed).

**Potential Value**:
```
max_bonuses_per_year = perf_bonus + award_bonus + playtime_bonus
max_escalator_value = base_AAV × (escalator_percent / 100) × (years - 1)
potential_value = guaranteed_value + (max_bonuses_per_year × years) + max_escalator_value + team_option_value
```

Maximum possible earnings if all incentives achieved.

**Average CBT Impact**:
```
cbt_impact = sum(yearly_cbt_hits) / years
```

### 7. Team Options

**Structure**:
- Team decides whether to exercise option for additional year(s)
- Option year salary predetermined
- Buyout amount if declined

**Value Calculation**:
```
If team_option_included:
    potential_value += team_option_value
```

Counted in potential value, not guaranteed value.

### 1. Data Sources

**FanGraphs (`fangraphs.csv`)**:
- Offensive stats: wRC+, OPS, xwOBA, xSLG, BB%, K%, PA, WAR
- Defensive stats: Def, BsR
- Fielding: Position, Games played

**Statcast (`statscast.csv`)**:
- Batted ball metrics: Barrel%, Hard Hit%, avgEV, maxEV
- Contact quality: Contact%

**Spotrac (`spotrac.csv`)**:
- Contract details: AAV, Years, Signing year
- Contract structure information

**Positions (`Positions.csv`)**:
- Season-by-season position data
- Primary position determination
- Team history by season

### 2. Data Processing

**Player Name Normalization**:
```
normalize(name):
    - Convert to lowercase
    - Remove accents and diacritics
    - Remove Jr., Sr., II, III suffixes
    - Trim whitespace
    - Handle middle names/initials consistently
```

**CSV Merging**:
1. Load all CSVs in parallel
2. Normalize player names
3. Merge by normalized name (FanGraphs as base)
4. Join Statcast and Spotrac data by player name + season
5. Handle missing data with fallback values

**Primary Position Determination**:
```
For each player across relevant seasons:
    Count games/innings at each position
    Primary position = position with most games
```

Uses `Positions.csv` for authoritative position data.

**Team Abbreviation Normalization**:
```
Handles variants:
    ARI/ARZ/AZ → ARI
    SD/SDP → SD
    SF/SFG → SF
    CHW/CWS → CHW
    KC/KCR → KC
    TB/TBR → TB
    WSH/WSN → WSH
    OAK/ATH → OAK
    LAA/ANA → LAA
```

### 3. Statistical Time Periods

**2025 Season**: Most recent season data

**3-Year Average**: Mean of 2023-2025 seasons (or available subset)

**3-Year Pre-Contract**: For comparable players, 3-year avg before contract signing

**Career Average**: All available seasons, weighted mean

**Aggregation Formula**:
```
For counting stats (HR, RBI, PA):
    aggregate = sum(values) / num_seasons

For rate stats (wRC+, OPS, AVG, etc.):
    aggregate = mean(values)

For age:
    aggregate = mean(ages)
```

### 4. Inflation Adjustment

**Formula**:
```
years_since_signing = current_year - contract_signing_year
inflation_multiplier = (1 + inflation_rate)^years_since_signing
adjusted_aav = historical_aav × inflation_multiplier
```

**Default Settings**:
- Inflation rate: 5% per year
- Present year: 2025
- Adjustable: 0-15% range

## Calculation Validation & Bounds

### 1. AAV Multiplier Bounds

```
Raw multiplier = weighted_sum / total_weight
Final multiplier = clamp(raw_multiplier, 0.75, 1.4)
```

Prevents extreme valuations:
- Minimum: 75% of baseline (poor performance)
- Maximum: 140% of baseline (elite performance)

### 2. Years Adjustment Bounds

```
age_multiplier: [0.6, 1.5]
absolute_age_penalty: [0, 2.0]
performance_adjustment: [-1.5, 1.5]

minimum_years: 1.0
```

### 3. Stat Ratio Bounds

```
For most stats: ratio clamped to [0.1, 10.0]
For Def/BsR: ratio clamped to [0.5, 2.0]
```

Prevents divide-by-zero and extreme outliers.
